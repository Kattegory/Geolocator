			<h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
				<p>The first step in running our measurement software is to determine the latitude and longitude of each computer you plan to run it on, to at least 1/100 of a degree. This is roughly half an arcminute, or 1km of position uncertainty, depending on the latitude. The best way to do this is with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a>; most smartphones can take a GPS reading. The iPhone ships with a “Compass” utility that, among other things, shows you your latitude and longitude (in degrees, minutes, and seconds; you will have to convert). For Android, you need a third-party app: we suggest “<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gpscoordinatesandlocation">My GPS Coordinates</a>”. If you don’t have a GPS-capable phone or dedicated receiver, or you can’t go to where the computer is and take a GPS reading, the next best option is to look up the postal address of the building, using one of the several conversion services available online (e.g. <a href="http://stevemorse.org/jcal/latlon.php">1</a>, <a href="http://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html">2</a>, <a href="http://www.gps-coordinates.net/">3</a>). In this case, please make sure to feed the latitude and longitude back into a mapping service and verify that it’s accurate.</p>
				<p><em>Don’t</em> look the computer’s IP address up in a geolocation service to get its latitude and longitude, because one of the goals of this project is to audit the accuracy of those services.</p>
				<p>The measurement software is only available as a Git checkout. It has two components, one written in Python and the other in C. The Python component has no dependencies outside the standard library, and is known to work with versions 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5 of the interpreter. The C component is self-contained (not a Python module), depends only on standard ISO C and POSIX interfaces, and is known to work on recent versions of Linux, FreeBSD, and OSX. It should work on any modern Unix. (If you know how to time TCP handshakes with high accuracy on Windows, we’d be glad to take your patches.) You are encouraged to read the <a href="https://github.com/zackw/active-geolocator/tree/master/measurement-client/">source code</a> of both components before running them. You may also be interested in reading our high-level <a href="methods.html">description of how it works</a>.</p>
				<p>Once you have the latitude and longitude of the computer, open a shell window and type the following commands:</p>
				<ul class="code">
					<li>git clone https://github.com/zackw/active-geolocator</li>
					<li>cd active-geolocator/measurement-client</li>
					<li>./configure</li>
					<li>make</li>
					<li>./probe --latitude=&lt;LATITUDE&gt; --longitude=&lt;LONGITUDE&gt;</li>
				</ul>
				<p>where <span class="code">&lt;LATITUDE&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;LONGITUDE&gt;</span> are the latitude and longitude you looked up earlier, as decimal degrees. Use negative numbers for south of the equator / west of Greenwich, and remember to round off the numbers to the precision you are comfortable with. If you don’t want the data you submit to be included in any future publication of a redacted version of our database, append <span class="code">--no-publication</span> to the <span class="code">probe</span> command.</p>
				<p>The final <span class="code">probe</span> command may take two or three hours to run; it reports its progress once a minute.  The results are automatically uploaded to the project website, and are also written to a file <span class="code">probe-result-YYYY-MM-DD-N.json</span> in the working directory.</p>
				<p>By running <span class="code">probe</span>, you assert that you are age 18 or older, and you consent to the collection of your computer’s IP address, its latitude and longitude as reported by you, and the time it takes network messages to reach roughly 500 other computers and return. You understand and agree that Carnegie Mellon is legally required to preserve all research data for at least three years, and could be required to disclose your location and IP address by a future law, regulation, subpoena or court order.</p>
				<p>If any of the above commands fail, please <a href="https://github.com/zackw/active-geolocator/issues/new">file an issue</a>. We will need to see the unedited, complete output of the commands up to the point where they failed, and we will also need to know which operating system and compiler you are using. If a file named <span class="code">config.log</span> exists in the working directory, please attach it to the issue (you may have to rename it <span class="code">config.txt</span> first, because Github). Note: to maintain the confidentiality of your IP address and location, do <em>not</em> attach any <span class="code">probe-result-*.json</span> files to Github issues.</p>
				<p>If you have access to computers in several cities, please do run the software on all of them.  It’s not as helpful to run it on more than one computer in the <em>same</em> city, unless their routes to the Internet backbone are very different (for instance, if one gets its connectivity from a residential ISP, and another from a cellphone system).</p>
				<p>If you have access to VPN or SOCKSv5 proxies, and you can find out the accurate location of the proxy <em>as well as</em> the client host, please do run the measurement through the proxy.  For VPNs, activate the VPN as the default route, then do:</p>
				<ul class="code">
					<li> ./probe --latitude=&lt;CLIENT LAT&gt; --longitude=&lt;CLIENT LONG&gt; \</li>
				    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--proxy-latitude=&lt;PROXY LAT&gt; --proxy-longitude=&lt;PROXY LONG&gt;</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For SOCKS you must explicitly state the proxy’s address. Authentication is not supported.</p>
				<ul class="code">
					<li> ./probe --latitude=&lt;CLIENT LAT&gt; --longitude=&lt;CLIENT LONG&gt; \</li>
				    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--proxy-latitude=&lt;PROXY LAT&gt; --proxy-longitude=&lt;PROXY LONG&gt; \</li>
				    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--socks5=&lt;HOST:PORT&gt;
				</ul>
