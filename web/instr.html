    <h1>Active Geolocation Project</h1>
    <h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>
    <p>The first step in running our measurement software is to determine
      the latitude and longitude of each computer you plan to run it on, to
      at least 1/100 of a degree. This is roughly half an arcminute, or 1km
      of position uncertainty, depending on the latitude. The best way to do
      this is with <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a>; most
      smartphones can take a GPS reading. The iPhone ships with a “Compass”
      utility that, among other things, shows you your latitude and longitude
      (in degrees, minutes, and seconds; you will have to convert). For
      Android, you need a third-party app: we suggest “<a href=
      "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gpscoordinatesandlocation">My
      GPS Coordinates</a>”. If you don’t have a GPS-capable phone or
      dedicated receiver, or you can’t go to where the computer is and take a
      GPS reading, the next best option is to look up the postal address of
      the building, using one of the several conversion services available
      online (e.g. <a href="http://stevemorse.org/jcal/latlon.php">1</a>,
      <a href=
      "http://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html">2</a>,
      <a href="http://www.gps-coordinates.net/">3</a>). In this case, please
      make sure to feed the latitude and longitude back into a mapping
      service and verify that it’s accurate.</p>
    <p><em>Don’t</em> look the computer’s IP address up in a geolocation
      service to get its latitude and longitude, because one of the goals of
      this project is to audit the accuracy of those services.</p>
    <p>The measurement software is only available as a Git checkout. It has
      two components, one written in Python and the other in C. The Python
      component has no dependencies outside the standard library, and is
      known to work with versions 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5 of the interpreter. The C
      component is self-contained (not a Python module), depends only on
      standard ISO C and POSIX interfaces, and is known to work on recent
      versions of Linux, FreeBSD, and OSX. It should work on any modern Unix.
      (If you know how to time TCP handshakes with high accuracy on Windows,
      we’d be glad to take your patches.) You are encouraged to read the
      <a href=
      "https://github.com/zackw/active-geolocator/tree/master/measurement-client/">
      source code</a> of both components before running them. You may also be
      interested in reading our high-level <a href="methods.html">description
      of how it works</a>.</p>
    <p>Once you have the latitude and longitude of the computer, open a
      shell window and type the following commands:</p>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/zackw/active-geolocator
cd active-geolocator/measurement-client
./configure
make
./probe --latitude=&lt;LATITUDE&gt; --longitude=&lt;LONGITUDE&gt;</pre>
    <p>where <code>&lt;LATITUDE&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;LONGITUDE&gt;</code>
      are the latitude and longitude you looked up earlier, as decimal
      degrees. Use negative numbers for south of the equator / west of
      Greenwich, and remember to round off the numbers to the precision you
      are comfortable with. If you don’t want the data you submit to be
      included in any future publication of a redacted version of our
      database, append <code>--no-publication</code> to the <code>probe</code>
      command.</p>
    <p>The final <code>probe</code> command may take two or
      three hours to run; it reports its progress once a minute. The results
      are automatically uploaded to the project website, and are also written
      to a file <code>probe-result-YYYY-MM-DD-N.json</code> in
      the working directory.</p>
    <p>By running <code>probe</code>, you assert that you are
      age 18 or older, and you consent to the collection of your computer’s
      IP address, its latitude and longitude as reported by you, and the time
      it takes network messages to reach roughly 500 other computers and
      return. You understand and agree that Carnegie Mellon is legally
      required to preserve all research data for at least three years, and
      could be required to disclose your location and IP address by a future
      law, regulation, subpoena or court order.</p>
    <p>If any of the above commands fail, please <a href=
      "https://github.com/zackw/active-geolocator/issues/new">file an
      issue</a>. We will need to see the unedited, complete output of the
      commands up to the point where they failed, and we will also need to
      know which operating system and compiler you are using. If a file named
      <code>config.log</code> exists in the working directory, please attach
      it to the issue (you may have to rename it <code>config.txt</code>
      first, because Github). Note: to maintain the confidentiality of your IP
      address and location, do <em>not</em> attach
      any <code>probe-result-*.json</code> files to Github issues.</p>
    <p>If you have access to computers in several cities, please do run the
      software on all of them. It’s not as helpful to run it on more than one
      computer in the <em>same</em> city, unless their routes to the Internet
      backbone are very different (for instance, if one gets its connectivity
      from a residential ISP, and another from a cellphone system).</p>
    <p>If you have access to VPN or SOCKSv5 proxies, and you can find out
      the accurate location of the proxy <em>as well as</em> the client host,
      please do run the measurement through the proxy. For VPNs, activate the
      VPN as the default route, then do:</p>
<pre>./probe --latitude=&lt;CLIENT LAT&gt; --longitude=&lt;CLIENT LONG&gt; \
        --proxy-latitude=&lt;PROXY LAT&gt; --proxy-longitude=&lt;PROXY LONG&gt;</pre>
    <p>For SOCKS you must explicitly state the proxy’s address.
      Authentication is not supported.</p>
<pre>./probe --latitude=&lt;CLIENT LAT&gt; --longitude=&lt;CLIENT LONG&gt; \
        --proxy-latitude=&lt;PROXY LAT&gt; --proxy-longitude=&lt;PROXY LONG&gt; \
        --socks5=&lt;HOST:PORT&gt;</pre>
