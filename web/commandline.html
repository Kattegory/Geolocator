    <h2>Command-line Measurement</h2>
    <p>In addition to the <a href="index.html">web-based demo and
        measurement client</a> that you may already have seen, we have
        a command-line tool for taking measurements.  It is more
        accurate than the browser-based measurement, and it can be
        used on computers that you only have remote shell access to.
        However, it doesn't work on Windows (if you know how to time
        TCP handshakes with high accuracy on Windows, we’d be glad to
        <a href="https://github.com/zackw/active-geolocator">take your
        patches</a>), and it is less user-friendly.</p>

    <p>When you run the tool, you need to tell it the location of the
      computer it’s running on, and whether it’s using a network
      proxy.  It will communicate with this server, and with roughly
      200 “landmark” servers around the world (the “anchor” servers of
      the <a href="https://atlas.ripe.net/">RIPE Atlas</a>).  We
      record all the information you provide, the round-trip time
      measurements, and the public IP address of the computer running
      the tool (if you are using a proxy, this will be the proxy’s
      address).

    <p>CMU’s Office of Research Integrity and Compliance requires
      us to warn you that the data we collect is considered
      “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">personally
        identifiable information</a>” under US law, and that the
      university is legally required to store all research data
      for at least three years.  We take care to protect it:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>We don’t ask for your name, your email address, or
        anything else about you.</li>
      <li>We only ask for your true location to within one
        kilometer (1/100 of a degree).</li>
      <li>All of the data is encrypted in transmission from your
        computer to our database.</li>
      <li>The database is on a computer under our physical
        control.  Only the researchers involved in this study have
        access to it.</li>
      <li>We will only reveal your IP address if required to do
        so by a future law, regulation, subpoena or court order.</li>
      <li>We might, in the future, publish a version of the
        database for other researchers to use. If we do this, the
        IP addresses will all be replaced with
        “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system"
            >autonomous system</a>” numbers, which identify each
        computer’s ISP but not the computer itself. If you don’t
        want us to publish even this much information, you can
        tell us so when you run the tool.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, participating in this study could still harm you,
      especially if our database is stolen.  The thief would be
      able to associate your IP address with your location, more
      precisely than they could if they only knew your IP address.
      If there’s someone specific who must not find out where you
      live, we recommend you don’t send us data collected by a
      computer in your house.</p>

    <p>Also, for legal reasons, please don’t send us any data if
      you are younger than 18 years old.</p>

    <p>If you want to ask questions about this study, before or
      after sending us data, please contact Zachary Weinberg
      at <a href="mailto:zackw@cmu.edu">zackw@cmu.edu</a>, or
      Nicolas Christin at
      <a href="mailto:nicolasc@cmu.edu">nicolasc@cmu.edu</a>.</p>

    <p>If you have concerns about this study, or questions about
      your rights as a research participant, you can contact the
      Office of Research Integrity and Compliance directly,
      at <a href="mailto:irb-review@andrew.cmu.edu">irb-review@andrew.cmu.edu</a>
      or <a href="tel:+14122681901">412-268-1901</a> or

    <h3>Determining the computer’s location</h3>

    <p>The best way to get the computer’s location is with <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a>;
      most smartphones can take a GPS reading. The iPhone ships with a
      “Compass” utility that, among other things, shows you your
      latitude and longitude (in degrees, minutes, and seconds; you
      will have to convert). For Android, you need a third-party app:
      we suggest “<a href=
      "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gpscoordinatesandlocation">My
      GPS Coordinates</a>”. If you don’t have a GPS-capable phone or
      dedicated receiver, or you can’t go to where the computer is and
      take a GPS reading, the next best option is to look up the
      postal address of the building in an address-to-location
      service, such
      as <a href="http://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long/.html">latlong.net</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Don’t</em> look the computer’s IP address up in a geolocation
      service to get its latitude and longitude, because one of the goals of
      this project is to audit the accuracy of those services.</p>

    <h3>Running the command-line tool</h3>

    <p>The measurement software is only available as a Git
      checkout. It has two components, one written in Python and the
      other in C. The Python component has no dependencies outside the
      standard library, and is known to work with versions 2.7, 3.4,
      and 3.5 of the interpreter. The C component is self-contained
      (not a Python module), depends only on standard ISO C and POSIX
      interfaces, and is known to work on recent versions of Linux,
      FreeBSD, and OSX. It should work on any modern Unix.  (If you
      know how to time TCP handshakes with high accuracy on Windows,
      we’d be glad to
        <a href="https://github.com/zackw/active-geolocator">take your
        patches</a>.)  You are encouraged to read the
      <a href=
      "https://github.com/zackw/active-geolocator/tree/master/measurement-client/">
      source code</a> of both components before running them.</p>
    <p>Once you have the latitude and longitude of the computer, open a
      shell window and type the following commands:</p>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/zackw/active-geolocator
cd active-geolocator/measurement-client
./configure
make
./probe --latitude=&lt;LATITUDE&gt; --longitude=&lt;LONGITUDE&gt;</pre>
    <p>where <code>&lt;LATITUDE&gt;</code>
      and <code>&lt;LONGITUDE&gt;</code> are the latitude and
      longitude you looked up earlier, as decimal degrees. Use
      negative numbers for south of the equator / west of
      Greenwich. If you don’t want the data you submit to be included
      in any future publication of a redacted version of our database,
      append <code>--no-publication</code> to the <code>probe</code>
      command.</p>
    <p>The final <code>probe</code> command may take as much as an hour to
      run, but 5 to 20 minutes is more typical.  It reports its progress once
      a minute. The results are automatically uploaded to the project website,
      and are also written to a
      file <code>probe-result-YYYY-MM-DD-N.json</code> in the working
      directory.</p>
    <p>If any of the above commands fail, please <a href=
      "https://github.com/zackw/active-geolocator/issues/new">file an
      issue</a>. We will need to see the unedited, complete output of the
      commands up to the point where they failed, and we will also need to
      know which operating system and compiler you are using. If a file named
      <code>config.log</code> exists in the working directory, please
      attach it to the issue (you may have to rename
      it <code>config.txt</code> first, because
      Github). Do <em>not</em> attach
      any <code>probe-result-*.json</code> files to Github issues;
      this would link your physical location to your Github
      identity.</p>
    <p>If you have access to computers in several cities, please do run the
      software on all of them. It’s not as helpful to run it on more than one
      computer in the <em>same</em> city, unless their routes to the Internet
      backbone are very different (for instance, if one gets its connectivity
      from a residential ISP, and another from a cellphone system).</p>
    <p>If you have access to VPN or SOCKSv5 proxies, and you can find out
      the accurate location of the proxy <em>as well as</em> the client host,
      please do run the measurement through the proxy. For VPNs, activate the
      VPN as the default route, then do:</p>
<pre>./probe --latitude=&lt;CLIENT LAT&gt; --longitude=&lt;CLIENT LONG&gt; \
        --proxy-latitude=&lt;PROXY LAT&gt; --proxy-longitude=&lt;PROXY LONG&gt;</pre>
    <p>For SOCKS you must explicitly state the proxy’s address.
      Authentication is not supported.</p>
<pre>./probe --latitude=&lt;CLIENT LAT&gt; --longitude=&lt;CLIENT LONG&gt; \
        --proxy-latitude=&lt;PROXY LAT&gt; --proxy-longitude=&lt;PROXY LONG&gt; \
        --socks5=&lt;HOST:PORT&gt;</pre>
