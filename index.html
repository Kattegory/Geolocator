			<p>Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University are testing “active geolocation” algorithms, which attempt to determine where in the world a computer is, by measuring how long it takes network messages from that computer to reach other computers in known locations. We need volunteers to run our experimental software on computers located all over the world. We are especially looking for volunteers who can run the software on computers that are not in Europe or North America.
			You should only run the software on computers whose physical location you know, and are willing to tell us, to within 1 km of precision (two decimal places of latitude and longitude).
			Presently the software can only be run from a Unix command line; you will need to retrieve it from a Git repository, you will need a recent Python interpreter (2.7, 3.4, and 3.5 are all known to work), and you will also need to compile a small, standalone C program (not a Python extension). If you don’t know what these terms mean, or how to do these things, please stay tuned for the user-friendlier version which is in development.
			If you are interested in volunteering, please visit the website for this study, which describes the project in more detail, and explains how to help. We regret to say we cannot offer any compensation for your assistance. For legal reasons, you must be at least 18 years old to volunteer.</p>
